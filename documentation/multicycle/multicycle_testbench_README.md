## Block Diagrams
Important aspects of every stage.
### **Fetch Stage Diagram:**
Fetch stage keeps the instruction memory inside and distribute it throughout the pipeline. It has a *pc_bias* port which makes it possible to load a program counter value, and it also counts with an *pc_en*, which allows the following instruction when rising clock edge comes.
In the diagram it is detailed that *flow control* instructions, which are capable of taking control of the following instruction, are detected and resolved in Execute stage.

### **Decode Stage Diagram:**
![exec_stage](Diagram_decode_stage.png)

### **Execute Stage Diagram:**
Execute stage mostly computes operations whenever its needed. Usually its inputs are driven from decode stage, but in *movement* or *flow control* operations, *Imm*, *Imm* *, zeros, and forwarding inputs need to be included.
![exec_stage](Diagram_execute_stage.png)

### **Memory Stage Diagram:**
Memory stage is simple. When data memory needs to be written its input can either come from C register (*store* instruction) or from the Imm* extension register (*storei* instruction). So, input MUX decides whether to choose regC which goes throughout the pipeline, Imm* which can be selected from the current instruction, or in the special case (forwarding) where the previous instruction intended to write C register, then it can come frome the WriteBack Stage. On the other hand, mem_address which is used for writing and reading instructions, and it always comes from alu output.

### **WriteBack Stage Diagram:**
Write back output changes in the following way:
- wb_output = mem_output  in *load* instruction.
- wb_output = *Imm* * in *storei* instruction.
- wb_output = *pc+8'd1* in case of *jal* or *jral* instructions.
- wb_output = alu in all the other cases.

<u> Observe the following: </u>
- In *ADD* operation (PCF=5 in Fetch Stage, PCE=3 in Execute Stage) a Forwarding Hazard should arise, since register 31 is inteded to use, which has been prevously written.
- In *LOADI* operation (PCE=9) a Forwarding Hazard should arise, since Imm*=63 which makes Rc field be 5'b11111. This goofs Hazard unit into thinking that Rc field is 31st register and 2 operations before, in *LOAD* operation, 31st register was intended to be written (detected in writeback stage). This wont make any change, since ALU control will handle it, ignoring hazard.
- In *STOREI* operation (PCE=10) a Forwarding Hazard should arise, since its intended to use Rb=31 register to access memory, but previous operation *LOADI* tries to write register 31. A 63 should be passed.
- Second call to *LOAD* operation (PCE=12) was introduced to force a Stall Hazard. *LOAD* intends to write 31st register from memory but in Decode Stage is detected that next operation will need that 31st register to do an ALU computation. This will force the pipeline to stop for a while until memory is addressed, and in next clock a Forwarding is made from WriteBack Stage up to Execute Stage.
- Last *RET* instruction goes back to *BV* instruction, thus RISC enters a loop from 19th instruction and on.

### Hazards
<u> How hazards are detected? </u>
1. **FORWARDING:** forwarding is asserted high whenever the Rb or Rc field of instruction in Execute Stage is the same as the Ra field in Memory or WriteBack Stage. This means that whenever Imm* use is intended, encompassing Rc field, a hazard may arise. These special cases are addressed in control unit.
2. **STALL:** stall hazard is arised when in Memory Stage, a *LOAD* instruction is detected and the destination address is the same as an Rb or Rc address in Execute Stage. This will flush Decode Stage Register.
3. **BRANCH:** branch control hazard is arised whenever a FLOW CONTROL instruction is detected in the Execute Stage. This will flush Decode and Execute registers, and stall Decode Register.

### Target testbench executed
These are the instructions tested in target_testbench. The whole system, signals and waveforms, instructions, and operations, were followed and checked. The following diagram may help as a road map:
- In green, instructions that shall be executed.
- In yellow, instructions that arise hazards. When a hazard occur, the stages involved are highlighted, indicating for example the origin and destination of a forwarding hazard.
- In blue, instructions, flushes, or actions executed in order to solve hazards.
- In red, garbage instructions which shouldnt be executed
![instructions](target_instructions.png)

Some remarks about the comparisons executed:
1. **TEST N0 - 4th clock**:
   - Memory: input should be 32'hffffffff since it comes from regC, *addc* is in decode stage addressing regC -> reg[30] = 32'hfffffff
   - Decode: *regA* input data is 1 as *or* operation is on WriteBack stage.
2. **TEST N1 - 8th clock**:
   - Memory: input should be 32'h16 since it comes from decode stage *regC*. *load 31,23,22* is in decode stage addressing regC -> reg[22] = 32'd22 = 32h16
   - Decode: *regA* input data is 34'h30000001c as *subc* operation is on WriteBack stage. *subc* operation makes 32'h0000001c - 32'hffffffff - 32'd1, so the result is a *1c* with underflow, in the MSB.
3. **TEST N2 - 13th clock**:
   - Memory: memory addr is 42 since two clocks before *load* instruction loaded 31st register from memory, acquiring 32'h3d155142 value. Then, since memory addr uses the 8 LSbits, its value is 42.


### Random testbench
Random testbench uses a randomized program counter memory, which is product of a python script. The main idea of the testbench is to compare the output of the different stages between the top module and the stages recreated in a model made in System Verilog (multicycle_model.sv).
